GRIDInterpreter is a program to import GRID Receiver log files into a database.


REQUIREMENTS

Linux/Unix -            Almost any version of linux/unix is needed, specificly for one line of code, 
                            I may change this if needed in the future
MySQL server >= v5.1 -  Either MySQL server running locally, or the IP address of a server running remotely.
libstdc++5 -            Needed to compile the source code.
CMake v2.6 or higher -  Needed to create the makeFile in order to compile the source code.

Directories named GRIDXXX-log and one set of .log files (channel.log, iono.log, etc.) in each directory. 
It should look something like this:

~/receivedFiles/GRID019-log/
    -channel.log
    -iono.log
    -navsol.log
    -scint.log
    -txinfo.log
~/receivedFiles/GRID020-log/
    -channel.log
    -navsol.log
...



COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS

1. run 'cmake -i' for interactive mode
2. run 'make'



RUN INSTRUCTIONS

1. if gridinterpreter.config is not found, create a new one with needed parameters:
    db_name=NAME_OF_DATABASE;
    db_hostname=HOSTNAME_OF_DATABASE;
    db_username=DATABASE_USERNAME;
    db_password=DATABASE_PASSWORD;
    top_level_directory=FULL_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_WHERE_GRID_RECEIVER_EXPANDED_LOGFILES_ARE_STORED;
    delete_log_file_after_import=1_OR_0_TO_DELETE_LOG_FILES_AFTER_FINISHED_IMPORTING;
2. run 'GRIDInterpreter' to import all .log files into the specified MySQL server.



TODO

- Fix the problem of not deleting the directory after importing the .log files
- Automatically create the .config file if it's not found after running.
- Add the ability to configure the .log file structure in the config file, so instead of recompiling 
    the source when the .log files change, you can just modify the structure in the .config file.
